# Assignment: SPA

This is our solution to the assignment 'SPA' in the 'Flask' module.

## First-time set-up

- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project.
- Run `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` to make sure pip is up to date.
- Run `python3 -m venv env` to set up a virtual environment.
- Run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to load the necessary packages into your virtual environment.

## Usage
- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project.
- Run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
- Run `FLASK_APP=main:app flask run` to start the server.
- Open up the website in your browser by navigating to the URL that Flask shows (default: `localhost:5000`).

P.S. Once you're done working on your project, you can deactivate the virtual Python environment by simply running the command `deactivate`.
